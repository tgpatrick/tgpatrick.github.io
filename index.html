        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>My apps do not use any information that you do not explicitly give them.</p>
        <p>The only information they may store is a name you typed in, reminders that you requested, or, in the case of PeePal, your current location.
            Even in those cases, all information is stored locally; I do not have access to it.
            PeePal uses your location (if you grant it) to show you restrooms near you, and it is sent (with no identifying information) to the <a href="https://www.refugerestrooms.org/">Refuge Restrooms</a> API.
            Refuge Restrooms reveives only a latitude and longitude, so it neither receives nor stores your personal information.
